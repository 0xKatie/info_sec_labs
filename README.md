### Incident Response Triage - Preparing the Environment for Detection

- **Initial Compromise Detection**:
  - Identify unauthorized RDP login alerts in SIEM logs (Security Onion, QRadar, Splunk, Palo Alto DMZ firewall).
  - Review RDP logs in Event Viewer on a web server (access remote host).
- **Web Shell Deployment Detection**:
  - Examine Security Onion alerts for PowerShell user-agent activities.
  - Locate and analyze a web shell installed in the IIS web root (using QRadar).
- **Lateral Movement & Domain Controller Compromise**:
  - Trace usage of PsExec and credential reuse with SAM tools in Security Onion.
  - Pivot to QRadar for further analysis.
  - Identify AD database dump via `ntdsutil` utility in Windows temp directory using QRadar.
  - Review Windows audit events for the DC.
- **Exfiltration & Alert Response**:
  - Detect exfiltration of `ntds.dit.zip` using SIEM tools (Security Onion and Splunk).
  - Analyze and respond to SIEM alert for HTTP transfer to an external IP (Security Onion & Splunk).
